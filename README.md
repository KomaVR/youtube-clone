# YouTube Clone

## Project Overview

YouTube Clone is a simple web application that replicates the user interface and core functionalities of YouTube. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding web development principles, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can navigate through a video-centric layout that features a header, sidebar, search functionality, and a grid of video thumbnails.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-clone.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd youtube-clone
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser**:
   Simply double-click the `index.html` file or open it directly from your preferred browser.

## Usage

After opening the project in a web browser, you can:

- Explore the different navigation links provided in the sidebar.
- Use the search feature to look for specific videos (the search functionality is a placeholder and does not perform actual searches).
- View video cards, each displaying video thumbnails, titles, channel names, and view counts.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes for a better user experience.
- **Search Form**: A functional search form provides a space to input search queries (dummy functionality).
- **Video Navigation**: A sidebar with links for easy navigation to various sections similar to YouTube.
- **Video Thumbnails**: Display of video cards with thumbnails, titles, and meta-info like view counts.

## Dependencies

This project does not have external dependencies specified in a package.json file, as it is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation. However, make sure to include reliable sources for CSS and JS if you plan to extend functionality in the future.
